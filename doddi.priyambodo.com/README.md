This is a modern web application built with the following architecture:

   * Framework: Next.js (https://nextjs.org/) (version 14), a popular React-based
     framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications.
   * Language: TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a statically typed
     superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
   * UI Library: React (https://react.dev/) (version 18), the foundation for building
     the user interface components.
   * Styling: Tailwind CSS (https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework
     for rapid UI development. It's configured with postcss.config.mjs and
     tailwind.config.ts.
   * Component Toolkit: The project uses libraries like @radix-ui/react-icons,
     lucide-react, class-variance-authority, and clsx, which are commonly associated
     with shadcn/ui (https://ui.shadcn.com/). This suggests a focus on building a
     design system of reusable and accessible UI components.
   * Deployment: A Dockerfile is present, indicating that the application is designed
     to be deployed using Docker (https://www.docker.com/) containers, which provides
     a consistent and isolated environment.

  In summary, this is a TypeScript-based Next.js project with a focus on a modern,
  component-based architecture using Tailwind CSS and likely a shadcn/ui-inspired
  component library. The use of Docker suggests a robust deployment strategy.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
